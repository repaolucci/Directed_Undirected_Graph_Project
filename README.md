# CS-261-Assignment-6

This assignment is comprised of 2 parts.
The first part involves the implementation of a undirected graph ADT , where the vertices and edges should be stored as an adjacency list. 
The second part involves implementing a directed graph ADT where the vertices and edges should be stored using an adjacency matrix. 

There is a main function in each python file (for directed and undirected graphs) with test cases.
